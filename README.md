Hi, I am Shafin, the manager of AIVersity. This is my library of controlling a servo with a raspberry pi. When I was using my servo with my Raspberry Pi, I was having difficulty with giving the direction of the servo with a number instead of an angle like we give in an Arduino. So keeping that in mind I created a library in which we can give an angle to a servo the same way you give the angle to the Arduino. 


Look At My Documentations For [Installing](http://aiversity.com/installation-of-servorpi/) And [Using](http://aiversity.com/usage-of-servorpi/) The Library
